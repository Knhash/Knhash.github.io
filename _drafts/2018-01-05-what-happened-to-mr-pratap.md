We have a games period today. Oh and library period too. No assignments to be submitted and no exams or tests today. It’s been ages since I’ve taken a leave, I don’t think anyone would notice. Also, this seems much more interesting than sitting in class. **Yes, I’m justifying. Making up reasons.** Why? I’m following Mr Pratap. Not Mr Not Pratap. But Mr Pratap. Yeah, I’ve been thinking, the whole _malicious clone taking his place_ seemed a bit off to me as well. I read the newspaper occasionally. Cloning technology is a ways off. So that means Mr Pratap is just being weird. Just a tiny bit. Just the smile bit. But I noticed. So I’m following Mr Pratap. 

> Right now. 

It was a spur of the moment decision. There was actually a lot of thinking but it happened quickly. But mainly, it was because Mr Pratap got down at a bus stop. **Suddenly.** Like he was in a hurry. He just bolted upright seconds before the stop and he was out. Like he just realized he had to get down here. That wasn’t like Mr Pratap. He is always calm and collected. And moved slowly with a purpose in his step. 

> And this isn’t his stop. 

He never gets down here. I have always seen him ride along even after I get down. There are about seven stops after my stop and my stop was still about ten stops away. And he got down. Practically the middle of nowhere. In a hurry. And I could cut my classes for a while so you see why I followed him right? _Right_. 

So I got down too. He didn’t notice me because he was already briskly walking away from the bus stop. I was going to run after of him when I noticed his bag. His attaché. It was left by the side of the bench at the bus stop. I look at Mr Pratap quickly walking off and then at the bag. I make another decision. 

> Today seems to be all about making quick decisions. 

Mr Pratap seems worried. Or horrified I think. His mouth is open but he is not speaking. People usually like having their things returned to them. Apparently, Mr Pratap didn’t. He stares at his attaché for a while, frozen. He then grabs the attaché and starts walking back towards the bus stop. He looks back at me while walking and shakes his head. He goes back to the seat, waits for the bus standing there to leave. The bus stop begins clearing out and he places the bag beside the seat in the corner and starts moving away. He is walking towards me. He looks me in the eye and then darts his eyes down. He does it again. **Oh, he wants me to look down.** 

His hand is rapidly doing a pushing away motion. He wants me to leave. He wants me to go away. He seems desperate that I go away from there. But I’m standing still. I still can’t get his face out of my mind. It didn’t make any sense. People like having their stuff. Why was Mr Pratap worried? Why did he leave his bag behind? **And why was Mr Pratap holding me by the shoulders and steering me away from the bus stop?** 

> There’s just too many questions today. I need to calm down. I need to think.
