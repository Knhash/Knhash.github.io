Somebody *else* did. Attaché, spectacles and dark chocolate waistcoat. Neat hair, pressed shirt. Exactly like Mr Pratap. But this wasn’t Mr Pratap. He walked, dressed just like Mr Pratap. He took the window seat, just like Mr Pratap. But he didn’t smile at me. 

> Mr Not Pratap. The clone.

That was its mistake, something that a prolonged observation of a person to imitate him might have missed: the small human interactions. The smile was a subtle greeting. Knowing Mr Pratap, the meticulous man that he was, he wouldn’t forget to smile at me. It’s a tradition, a ritual. Walk towards the seat, look to the right, smile, take the seat. The clone wouldn't have captured it. 

**Then the conductor comes.** 

Mr Not Pratap doesn't show him the pass. I am looking at it, observing it. Mr Not Pratap reaches into its shirt pocket and pulls out some money. Mr Pratap pays for its ticket. The conductor is confused. Mr Not Pratap simply smiles back. *But it doesn’t reach his eyes*. It’s not a smile, it’s an imitation of a smile. Mr Not Pratap is not Mr Pratap. The conductor cuts out the ticket, hands it over and moves on.

> What happened to Mr Pratap? Where is Mr Pratap?

I should ask someone. _The conductor_. Yes. No. That wouldn't help, all I do is show him my pass. And he nods. No communication otherwise. It would be supremely awkward to have a conversation with him about something I can't even properly describe. Besides, Mr Pratap doesn't talk with him either, so the conductor is useless. But something is definitely wrong. 

> So what do I know? 

This _thing_ isn't Mr Pratap. Mr Pratap smiles warmly. Mr Pratap has a traveler's pass. _Right_. It could have the whole world fooled but not me. It is an imitator. Maybe it is responsible for whatever happened to Mr Pratap. Should I follow it? It might be dangerous. 

**But wait.** It could be nothing. Maybe this isn't a clone but Mr Pratap himself. Maybe he is just having a bad day, forgot his pass. _It is a possibility._ Still, that explains his mood, but how did he know he didn't have the pass before even checking his bag? Why did he pay for his ticket? So many questions. This is bothering me.

> I need to find out. 

It would be awesome if this actually were a clone. I may be delusional, making a big thing out of a molehill? Ah, mountain out of a molehill. But the curious behavior... I can't explain it. It doesn't make sense. Especially the part about the pass. Asking the clone is out of the question, I couldn't possibly believe anything it says when its entire existence is in question. All I can do is observe it. Him. It. 

> _I will find out._
