Somebody else did. Attache, spectacles and dark chocolate waistcoat. Neat hair, pressed shirt. Exactly like Mr Pratap. But this wasn’t Mr Pratap. He walked, dressed just like Mr Pratap. He took the window seat, just like Mr Pratap.  But he didn’t smile at me. Mr Not Pratap. 

That was his mistake, something that a prolonged observation of a person to imitate him might have missed: the small human interactions. The smile was a subtle greeting. Knowing Mr Pratap, the meticulous man that he was, he wouldn’t forget. It’s a tradition, a ritual. Walk towards the seat, look to the right, smile, take the seat. Then the conductor comes. 

Mr Not Pratap shows him the pass. I look at him, I observe him. The conductor smiles and Mr Not Pratap smiles back. But it doesn’t reach his eyes. It’s not a smile, it’s an imitation of a smile. Mr Not Pratap is not Mr Pratap. What happened to Mr Pratap? Who is Mr Not Pratap?

I need to find out. I must talk to him. But how would that help? I had never talked to Mr Pratap. I have no baseline. How do I find if this man is a fake? But wait, I know he is. Right. So what do I need to find? Ah yes. What happened to Mr Pratap. I can’t find that by asking this man. He is an imitator. Maybe he is responsible for whatever happened to Mr Pratap. Could I follow him? No. Again, I have no reference to what Mr Pratap would do. I need to work backwards. Work with what I know. I know this isn’t Mr Pratap. I know where he boards the bus. 

I’m going to follow Mr Not Pratap tomorrow. 

Backwards. I will be waiting at the bus stop to see where he comes from. Then I’ll know where Mr Pratap comes from. Or I’ll know where Mr Not Pratap comes from. Either way I’ll find out something. 

Do not worry Mr Pratap. I will find you.
