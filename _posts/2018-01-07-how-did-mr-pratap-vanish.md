The bag is gone. 

I swear I had looked at it just the second before. Mr Pratap seemed insistent that I walk away from the bag and I was finding it difficult to come out of his grasp. I kept glancing backward and one moment it was there, the next it was gone. 

"You need to go away kid, why are you here?", Mr Pratap is whispering, very forcefully, Mr Pratap wants to shout but there are people around. He doesn't want the people around to pay attention to us.

"Don't you have to get to school? Why did you follow me? Stop looking at the bag! You need to stay away from the bag!"

I point out that the bag is gone. Mr Pratap seems relieved. "It is better this way, trust me. Hey, come back!". I get away from him just as I spot the girl looking over the bag, sitting at the bus stop. 

"Kid, listen to me, do not go near that bag! It is trouble, stay away from it!"

He starts to follow me back as I run over to the bus-stop but stops. I stop in between and realize this moment is straight out of the movies. At one end is Mr Pratap, and at the other is Mr Pratap's bag. The girl doesn't seem to be in any hurry, she is rifling through the contents of the bag. Decisions decisions. Where do I go? Mr Pratap seems extremely worried about the bag so he seems to be the safer option. Away from the bag. But if he is worried about the bag, shouldn't the girl stay away from the bag too? Shouldn't she be warned? Also, now I was getting very curious regarding the bag. What does it contain? 

Decisions decisions. 

The girl is pretty. One of the rag-pickers it looks like. Dirty, but pretty. Her dress is stained but I could see it was clean. Ok, she wasn't that dirty, she was me after three days of no bath. She probably had more days on the tally though. She sees me approaching and stops. She quickly puts her hand in and grabs something. She clutches the bag shut and starts standing up. She is going to run away, I can see it in her eyes. Fight or flight, she chooses flight.

By the time I reach the bus stop she is gone. The bag itself lay abandoned on the seat. It’s empty. It’s a small attaché, leather with a strap. Quite sturdy from the looks of it but couldn’t hold much. Exactly like the one Mr Pratap left. But not quite. I look back, Mr Pratap is no longer standing under the tree. He had been looking over from a distance but seems to have left. I look at the bag again. I am very sure it is the same bag, exact same color, and texture. But how could it be? It no longer said Mr Pratap

It said Miss Kiran.
