**"I looked at my watch. I was late by half an hour. It would take me another ten minutes to reach school. So if I hurry I could be just in time for the second period. I walked towards the bus stop and waited. The second bus to arrive was mine. It dropped me in front of my school."**

I paused for a breath. I am almost at the end now, and I need to come up with something. _Something nice._

**"I carried the bag of course. The attach√©. It kept shifting weight, sometimes growing heavy, sometimes becoming light. Never too hard to carry. But whenever I looked inside, it would be empty."**

I have many loose ends. I may not be able to tie them all up...

**"The guard did a double take when he looked at me. I had my backpack on my back and an adult bag in my hand. Decidedly out of place. He is supposed to hold me up for fifteen minutes before letting me in. But I was a friend. So after I signed the late-comers register he let me through."**

Oh well, time to wind up. I shall take a _gamble._

**"It was nine forty-five when I reached my class. I checked my watch, late by five minutes to the second period ", I look to my teacher, "and I enter my class. Just five minutes. Well, technically by forty-five minutes to school, but five minutes to class."**

The class is silent. _Even Rahul, who usually sleeps through the second period, is wide awake, looking at me._ They are waiting for it. For them, _the many answers_. But I am done. 

**"And?"**

**"That's it. I'm here."**

**"So miss Kiran, "** started my teacher, after a good minute of silence, **" that was, well, a long ten minutes. "** And she smiled. **"I stand corrected. I had not heard every reason there is. And this is probably the most compelling reason I have heard till date. You can go sit."**

**"Are you sure you that's the end of it though? Your, um, excuse? "**

**"Yes, ma'am. I'm afraid that is where it ends."**

**"Alright. You can take your seat."**

I walk to my place and sit down. The class has never been this silent. Raveena elbows me. **"Dude, show me the bag."**

**"There's nothing in there. It's empty."**

**"Did it really change weight?"**

I smile. _This year is going to be fun._
