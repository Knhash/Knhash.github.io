_The bag is gone._ 

I swear I had looked at it just the second before. Mr Pratap seemed insistent that I walk away from the bag and I was finding it difficult to come out of his grasp. I kept glancing backward and one moment it was there, the next it was gone. 

**"You need to go away kid, why are you here?"**, Mr Pratap is whispering, very insistent. Mr Pratap wants to shout but there are people around. He doesn't want the people around to pay attention to us.

**"Don't you have to get to school? Why did you follow me? Stop looking at the bag! You need to stay away from the bag!"**

I point out that the bag is gone. Mr Pratap seems relieved. **"It is better this way, trust me."**. I wiggle away from him and I spot a girl looking over a bag, the bag, at the bus stop on the opposite side of the road. Mr Pratap's bag. The attaché is quite distinctive looking. Thief. I start crossing the road.

**"Kid, listen to me, do not go near that bag! It is trouble, stay away from it!"**

He starts to follow me back but doesn't cross the road. Has he tired already? No. He has just given up. I stop in between and realize this moment is straight out of the movies. At one end is Mr Pratap. At the other end is the girl, with the bag. The girl doesn't seem to be going anywhere, she is rifling through the contents of the bag at leisure. She is perked up though, constantly looking around. The bag, it would seem, is not hers.  **Decisions decisions.** Where do I go? Mr Pratap seems extremely worried that the bag is dangerous, so he seems to be the safer option. Away from the bag. But if he is worried about the bag, shouldn't the girl stay away from the bag too? Shouldn't she be warned? Also, now I was getting very curious regarding the bag. What does it contain? 

> Decisions decisions. 

The girl is pretty. One of the rag-pickers it looks like. Ponytailed and wearing a frock, a huge plastic collection bag lying by her side. Pretty. Her dress is stained but I could see it was reasonably clean. She sees me approaching and stops. She quickly puts her hand in and grabs something. She closes the bag and starts standing up. She is going to run away, I can see it in her eyes. Fight or flight, fight or flight. _She chooses flight._

By the time I reach the bus stop she is gone. The bag itself lay abandoned on the seat. It’s empty. It’s a small attaché, leather, with a strap. Quite sturdy from the looks of it but couldn’t hold much. _Exactly like the one Mr Pratap left_. But not quite. I look back, Mr Pratap is no longer standing on the other side of the road. He had been looking over from a distance but seems to have left. I look at the bag again. I am very sure it is the same bag, exact same color, and texture. But it is not. It no longer said Mr Pratap

> It said **Miss Kiran.**
