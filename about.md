## About me


I spend my days being a Data Scientist at [Bright](https://www.brightmoney.co/) and my nights sleeping. I fancy myself a writer and riddler. I solve problems for a living, so hit me up if you have one. 

Culinary wise, I make the best Chappatis in the world.

This website is based on the awesome [Chalk](https://github.com/nielsenramon/chalk) theme.
